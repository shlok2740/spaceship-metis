**Spaceship Game - TON and Metis L2 Integration**

**Overview:**
The Spaceship Game is a mini-game built using Three.js that seamlessly bridges the TON blockchain and Metis Layer 2 (L2) network. This game combines the accessibility of the TON blockchain with the speed and efficiency of Metis, providing players a unique blend of decentralized interaction and fast-paced gaming.

**Concept:**
The game follows a storyline where the player pilots a spaceship escaping from a hostile base. To succeed, the player must navigate through a series of obstacles, represented as "pink cubes," each strategically positioned to impede the spaceship's path. As the game progresses, the obstacles become more complex and move faster, demanding increased agility and focus from the player.

**Gameplay Mechanics:**

1. **Objective:** 
   - The goal is to guide the spaceship to safety by avoiding collisions with pink cubes, representing various threats from the base.
   - Each level cleared advances the spaceship further from the base, increasing difficulty as more obstacles and speed changes are introduced.

2. **Controls:**
   - Simple arrow or touch-based controls to maneuver the spaceship up, down, left, or right.
   - The player's reflexes are tested as the pink cubes move in unpredictable patterns.

3. **Game Features:**
   - **TON Blockchain Integration:** The game is connected to the TON blockchain, where players can earn in-game assets or collectible NFTs as rewards for completing levels or high achievements.
   - **Metis L2 Speed Optimization:** By leveraging the Metis L2, the game can process interactions, including in-game purchases or score updates, with minimal latency, enhancing the gameplay experience.

4. **Reward System:**
   - Players earn tokens or collectible NFTs for achievements, such as high scores, levels completed, or time-based challenges.
   - These tokens/NFTs can be transferred or traded on both TON and Metis platforms, promoting a unique cross-chain asset experience.

5. **Cross-Chain Feature:**
   - This integration allows for cross-chain asset transfers between TON and Metis, enabling players to showcase or trade their in-game collectibles across different ecosystems.

**Technical Highlights:**

- **Three.js Rendering:** The 3D elements, including the spaceship and obstacles, are created using Three.js, making the visuals dynamic and immersive.
- **Blockchain Functions:** Integration with smart contracts allows for the minting and rewarding of in-game assets. The TON blockchain handles asset storage, while Metis L2 provides low-cost, high-speed transaction processing.
- **Adaptive Difficulty:** As players progress, the game uses a built-in difficulty curve where cubes become harder to dodge, increasing engagement and challenge.

This game introduces a fun, interactive way to experience the capabilities of both TON and Metis blockchain environments. The cross-chain functionality promotes interoperability and creates an ecosystem where players can earn, collect, and trade blockchain-based assets, blending gaming and blockchain in an exciting, accessible format.
